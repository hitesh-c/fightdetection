## Installation

Step 1: Open the official Python website in your web browser. Navigate to the Downloads tab for Windows.<br>
Step 2: Choose the latest Python 3 release. In our example, we choose the latest Python 3.7.3 version.<br>
Step 3: Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BXUmI8AgRXNSVaFKvpkQP7sQbaHWuwHT and copy in /data folder.<br>
Step 4: Load model using<br>
```Python
    #Mobnet_LSTM_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(folderlocation+'Mobnet_LSTM_model')
    #Mobnet_LSTM_model_history = np.load(folderlocation+'Mobnet_LSTM_model_history.npy',allow_pickle='TRUE').item()
```
